There was a temporary outage while we resolved this issue. The issue stemmed from the <code>monitor</code> service erroring due to a known issue with Prometheus.\nWe are looking into fixing that, but also ways to avoid the <code>router</code> baulking if an upstream service is unavailable as happened in this situation: <code> nginx: [emerg] host not found in upstream &quot;monitor&quot; in /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf:24</code>.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n"}
