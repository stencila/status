Logs indicated issues with workers connecting to the <code>broker</code> service. The broker pod was deleted (using <code>kubectrl delete pod</code> which automatically recreates a new one). We also deleted the single <code>worker</code> pod running at the time. This resolved the issue and monitoring is showing normal event processing by the <code>overseer</code> service.</p>\n</div></div></div>\n"}
